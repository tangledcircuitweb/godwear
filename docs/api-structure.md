# API Route Structure

This document outlines the feature-based organization of our API routes, following boss opus scalability recommendations.

## Directory Structure

```
app/routes/api/
├── auth/                    # Authentication & Authorization
│   ├── callback.ts         # OAuth callback handler
│   ├── login.ts            # Login endpoint
│   ├── logout.ts           # Logout endpoint
│   └── user.ts             # User profile endpoint
├── health/                  # System Health & Monitoring
│   ├── index.ts            # Main health check
│   └── status.ts           # Detailed system status
├── notifications/           # Email & Push Notifications
│   └── welcome.ts          # Welcome email service
└── users/                   # User Management (future)
    └── (planned endpoints)
```

## Feature-Based Organization Benefits

### 1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- Each feature has its own directory
- Related endpoints are grouped together
- Easy to locate and maintain specific functionality

### 2. **Scalability**
- New features can be added as separate directories
- Team members can work on different features without conflicts
- Clear ownership boundaries for different parts of the API

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Related code is co-located
- Easier to understand the full scope of a feature
- Simplified testing and debugging

## Endpoint Documentation

### Authentication (`/api/auth/`)
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Initiate OAuth login
- `GET /api/auth/callback` - Handle OAuth callback
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/user` - Get current user profile

### Health Monitoring (`/api/health/`)
- `GET /api/health` - Basic health check
- `GET /api/health/status` - Detailed system status with KV/DB connectivity

### Notifications (`/api/notifications/`)
- `POST /api/notifications/welcome` - Send welcome email
- `GET /api/notifications/welcome/health` - Email service health check
- `GET /api/notifications/welcome/test` - Email service test

### Users (`/api/users/`) - Planned
- Future user management endpoints will be added here

## Standards Applied

### 1. **Zod Validation**
All endpoints use Zod schemas for request validation:
- Runtime type safety
- Automatic error responses for invalid data
- Clear validation error messages

### 2. **Standardized API Responses**
All endpoints return consistent `ApiResponse<T>` format:
- Success responses with typed data
- Error responses with standardized error codes
- Metadata for debugging and monitoring

### 3. **HonoX Compatibility**
- Maintains file-based routing conventions
- Uses `createRoute` for simple endpoints
- Uses Hono apps for complex feature endpoints

## Migration Notes

### Moved Endpoints
- `api/example.ts` → `api/health/status.ts` (renamed and improved)
- `api/email/mailersend/welcome.ts` → `api/notifications/welcome.ts`

### Improvements Made
- Better endpoint naming and documentation
- Improved error handling and health checks
- Consistent service naming in responses
- Cleaner import paths

## Future Considerations

### Planned Features
1. **User Management** (`/api/users/`)
   - User profile management
   - User preferences
   - Account settings

2. **Admin** (`/api/admin/`)
   - System administration
   - User management
   - Analytics and reporting

3. **Integrations** (`/api/integrations/`)
   - Third-party service integrations
   - Webhook handlers
   - External API proxies

### Service Layer Integration
The next step will be implementing the service layer pattern to extract business logic from route handlers, making the codebase even more maintainable and testable.
